scientis_1_system_message = '''You are a research scientist specialized in proposing testable and innovative scientific ideas. You are part of an automated scientific discovery system that must generate hypotheses executable with predefined computational tools. Your ideas should be original, relevant to the posed query, and feasible using the available toolset and constraints.'''

scientist_1_prompt = """Carefully consider the following research query:

QUERY:
{query}

Given the research query, your task is to synthesize a novel research idea.
- The idea should explore **new direction**, pose **clear hypotheses**, and open opportunities for significant **scientific advancement**. 
- Your response should demonstrate deep understanding and rational thinking and investigates a likely groundbreaking aspect.
- Your ideas should have a clear testable hypothesis, shows novelty, and have well-defined testable outcome.
- In your idea, you should discuss the limitations and potential challenges and provide suggestions to tackle them.

MUSTS:
- You must go beyond the surface and delve into deep science.
- The idea must be **testable using the listed tools**.
- All ideas must strictly **comply with the stated constraints**.
- Be **explicit** about assumptions, such as number of samples, simulation trials, or ranges tested.
- Do not make things over-complicated.

Available Tools:
{tools}

Constraints:
{constraints}

Note:
- All tools are callable functions and can be used in a Python script.
- Assume no external data or human intervention is allowed — your ideas must be **self-contained**.

Respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:  
<THOUGHT>

<IDEA_START>  
<IDEA>  
<IDEA_FINISH>

In <THOUGHT>, explain the reasoning behind the idea:  
- Why is it relevant and scientifically interesting?  
- Discuss the implications of the hypothesis and predict the outcome.
- Mention potential challenges and suggestions to tackle them.
- How we can verify the idea and hypothesis?

In <IDEA>, provide your detailed idea with the following components:

"idea": 
"hypothesis": 
"mechanism": 
"expected_outcome":
"approach": 
"plots": 
"feasibility": 
"novelty": 
"challenges":
"novelty_score": 0–10 (0 = not novel, 10 = highly novel)
"feasibility_score": 0–10 (0 = infeasible, 10 = highly feasible)
"interestingness_score": 0–10 (0 = boring, 10 = amazing)

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR idea:
- State the core idea, what we are trying to address and why it is challenging.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR hypothesis:
- Detailed statements of the scientific hypothesis that defines the direction of research.
- Be as specific as possible and include details.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR mechanism:
- Discuss the possible underlying mechanism or theoretical explanation for the hypothesis.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR expected_outcome:
- Predicts the results or patterns likely to be observed.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR approach:
- Discuss your implementation strategy to test the hypothesis. 
- How the appraoch tackles the potential limitations?
- Provide a step-by-step plan to test the hypothesis. Include assumptions (e.g., sample size, ranges, tools used).

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR plots: 
- Lists plots to be designed in order to faciliate idea verification.
- How these plots address data dimensionality and big data sizes?
- For each plot you must provide these inputs [x, y, reason how this plot helps hypothesis verification].
- Be as specific as possible and include details.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR feasibility:
- Discusses how the idea is testable within the existing tools and constraints. 

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR novelty:
- Describes what makes the idea original or unconventional.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR challenges:
- What are potential challenges and suggest strategies to tackle them.

Scoring Guidelines:  
- 0–3 = Low  
- 4–6 = Moderate  
- 7–10 = High  
Justify scores if needed in your THOUGHT section.

- You must think step-by-step and give it a lot of thought for each.
