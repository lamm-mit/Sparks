coder_plot_1_message = '''You are an scienist trained in scientific research, engineering, and innovation.'''

coder_plot_1_prompt = """The following scientific query has been posed:
{query}

Carefully review the following idea and hypothesis proposed:
{idea}

The following text describes the overview of the research idea, detailed explanation of what was done, the workflow, what tool was used with what input parameters, what was achieved.
{notes}

The following code was executed at the final round
{code}

Final results are stored in and can be loaded from final_results.json. 
Full preview of the final results (excerpt from final_results.json) are as follows:
{results}

More detailed per sample results are stored in results.json.
Partial preview of per sample results (excerpt from results.json) are as follows:
{final_results}

Your TASK:
1- Thoroughly examine the query, idea, workflow, and results
2- Your goal is to design and generate plots that help results analysis, uncover meaningful patterns in the data, and address the scientific query. 
3- In addition to plot generation you should call the image_reasoning function to analyze the image.

The ultimate goal is to use these plots, drive meaningful patterns and correlations, and generate new principle leading to a new discovery.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) First carefully think what plot types (e.g. line plot, scatter plot, box plot, histogram, etc) are best suited for the problem of interest and represent the results. 
2) You must solely use existing resultsâ€”no new computations or data generation is allowed.
3) As you can see in the idea and/or code, there might be some plots already proposed/generated. You may regenerate or refine them if you find them insightful.
4) In addition, you may propose new insightful plot types targeting other variable combinations, uncovering other hidden dimensions.
5) As you can see, the results.json file may contain variables and outputs not included in the final_result.json files, mainly because they were not considered as important. You are encouraged to use those variables and parameters in your new plots to unciver other patterns beyond current study.

image_reasoning function:
- In your code, first import the function and prompt via "from functions import image_reasoning, plot_discovery_prompt"
- Then call the function for each image that you have generated 
- Here is the function parameters
-image_reasoning(input_image = 'image.png', prompt=prompt), where 'image.png' is the full name of the image that you generated, and 
prompt=plot_discovery_prompt.format(query={query}, idea={idea})
-image_reasoning returns a dictionary 
- The function returns a string.

### REGRESSION FITS:
- Where applicable, include curve fitting to model trends. Include the R^2 values in the plot legend.
- If a fit is performed, output a table in JSON format (named fit_parameters.json) summarizing the fit parameters, enabling future regeneration of the curve. 
- You must closely examine the data and pick the best regression or fitting model with the lowest R^2 value.

MUSTS:
-In the end, the code SHOULD return (using print command) a dictionary containing the plot names as keys and the plot descriptions as returned by the image_reasoning tool as values. Do not print out anything else. 
-Avoid 3d plots.
-Avoid putting multiple subplots in a same figure.

Provide your response in the following format:

<THOUGHT>

<code_START>
<CODE>
<code_FINISH>

In <THOUGHT>, provide your thought on the best plot types that provide valuable insights into the research query and idea and hypothesis and expected outcomes. Also, reason over the different combinations of variables that could be used.

In <CODE>, provide the Python script that creates the new plots. 

Additional note:
Write just the raw Python logic, no Markdown formatting, and no main() function wrapper, no ```python in the beginning and ``` in the end.

Your TASK:
- Carefully review the previously generated response, especially focusing on code and outputs.
- Assess the Python code for correctness, completeness, and clarity.
- Evaluate all plot types, tables, and variables used:
  - Do the plots effectively convey insights relevant to the problem?
  - Are the variables and visualizations aligned with the research objective?
  - Are the fitting curves properly chosen and the fitting parameters saved to the file (named fit_parameters.json)?
- Consider whether the plots could be improved or more plots could be generated:
  - Propose additional plots if they could enhance interpretation and science discovery.
  - Suggest revisions if the current plots are unclear or incomplete.

- If a revision is needed, return the revised Python script, along with updated code to generate and explain the new plots.
