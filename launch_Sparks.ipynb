Topology (block versus interleaved α/β) will modulate, but not negate, this enhancement.', 'mechanism': 'β-strands engage in early high-force hydrogen-bond rupture, providing an initial mechanical clamp. Surviving α-helical regions then unravel gradually, extending the work performed. Sequential failure of the two motifs yields a multiplicative—not merely additive—gain in F·E. Interleaving α and β segments may spread this effect over extension, while block designs concentrate it, providing a mechanistic handle on topology.', 'expected_outcome': '1) Force–Energy scatter shows mixed α/β peptides populating the upper-right quadrant.\\n2) Median F·E(mixed) > F·E(α-dominant) and F·E(β-dominant) with p < 0.05 (Kruskal-Wallis).\\n3) Synergy index S (definition above) has mean > 1.25 for mixed class and ~1 for controls.\\n4) Block vs interleaved variants show comparable F·E but distinct force-extension traces (more peaks in interleaved).', 'approach': 'Step 1 – Design (per length 30,40,50,60,70,80; ≤10 seq/length):\\n  • 3 α-biased (CATH=1), 3 β-biased (CATH=2), 2 mixed interleaved (CATH=3 then manual α/β patterning), 2 mixed block (CATH=3 but α stretch followed by β stretch). Replace sequences returning None or failing structure windows up to 5 tries.\\nStep 2 – Fold with fold_protein(); parse DSSP via analyze_protein_structure().\\nStep 3 – Filter: keep α-dominant (>70 % α), β-dominant (>70 % β), mixed (30–50 % α AND β). Others discarded/replaced.\\nStep 4 – Compute F and E with calculate_*; if None, redesign.\\nStep 5 – Derive F·E and synergy index S.\\nStep 6 – Statistics: Kruskal-Wallis on log(F·E); bootstrapped 95 % CI on S; exploratory ANCOVA for topology.\\nStep 7 – Validation: repeat whole pipeline with fresh random seeds (3 replicates) to confirm robustness.', 'plots': \"[1] x=Energy, y=Force, color=class, reason='Pareto front visualisation of mechanical space';\\n[2] x=class (α, β, mixed), y=F·E, reason='Box/violin plot to test median differences';\\n[3] x=α-content (%), y=β-content (%), color=F·E, reason='Heatmap locating optimal composition window';\\n[4] x=length, y=Synergy index S, color=topology, reason='Checks length dependence and topology effect';\\n[5] x=extension (nm equiv), y=force (arbitrary), multiple traces overlaid, reason='Qualitative view of block vs interleaved unfolding events'.\", 'feasibility': 'Total sequences ≤60; each requires ≤3 tool calls (fold, force, energy). Fits compute cap. All metrics are directly accessible via provided Python functions. Bootstrapping uses stored results—no extra tool calls.', 'novelty': 'Extends classic α vs β comparison to a compositional-synergy principle for ultra-short peptides, adds quantified synergy index and topology dimension; little or no precedent in literature for <100-aa systems.', 'challenges': '1) Random design may fail to reach exact α/β windows—mitigated by redesign loop and secondary-structure filter.\\n2) Folding errors for very short chains—accept relative comparisons; possibly run two different seeds for folding if available.\\n3) Force/Energy functions may return None—catch and replace sequence.\\n4) Small n—address with bootstrap CIs and non-parametric stats.\\n5) Topology enforcement (block vs interleaved) might not persist after folding; verify via DSSP segment order and discard if deviating.'}\n",
